# NewInTown Rainbowbody WordPress Plugin

Looking for a less predictable, more colorful lifestyle?

Rainbowbody generates a random background color for the body of your WordPress site every time you load a new page.

* The .rainbow-body class is attached to the body element of the document
* A hex color value is randomly generated
* This color is then passed as the background-color value for the .rainbow-body class
* Ta-da! Your page now has a new and exciting background color!
